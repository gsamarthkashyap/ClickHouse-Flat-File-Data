Prompt 1:
I’m working on Zeotap Assignment 2 – Bidirectional ClickHouse & Flat File Ingestion Tool. Please help me build this step-by-step using FastAPI and React. I want to skip optional tasks and focus on core requirements.

Prompt 2:
Help me connect FastAPI to a ClickHouse Docker container using clickhouse-connect and verify the connection with an endpoint.

Prompt 3:
How do I list all tables in ClickHouse using FastAPI?

Prompt 4:
How to get column names from a given ClickHouse table and return them as a JSON response?

Prompt 5:
Guide me on how to export specific columns from ClickHouse to a CSV file using pandas.

Prompt 6:
Help me design a FastAPI endpoint to upload a CSV file and extract its column headers.

Prompt 7:
How to append rows from an uploaded CSV file to an existing product.csv file only if columns match?

Prompt 8:
I’m getting a `NameError: name 'csv' is not defined` — what’s causing it?

Prompt 9:
Can you give me the full corrected version of `main.py` with all working endpoints?

Prompt 10:
Create a simple but functional React page that allows:
- Uploading a CSV file
- Selecting columns from ClickHouse table
- Triggering ingestion and showing success/error response

Prompt 11:
Make the React page more attractive with colors, spacing, and proper layout.

Prompt 12:
I’m struggling to understand how the backend is working from `main.py` onward. Please explain it step by step.
